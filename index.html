    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>EcoThrive Solutions was founded in 2025 by Ava Thompson, a passionate advocate for sustainable living and environmental responsibility. What began as a small initiative to provide eco-friendly school supplies to local classrooms quickly grew into a full-scale sustainable office product company. We started out selling recycled notebooks and compostable pens, and today we offer a wide range of products that serve homes, businesses, and institutions alike.</p>
    
    <p>Over the years, our company has expanded to serve customers nationwide, building strong partnerships with environmentally conscious manufacturers and distributors. Through our continued efforts to reduce waste, support ethical sourcing, and minimize our carbon footprint, we’ve become a trusted name in green business solutions. EcoThrive is more than a brand it's a movement towards a cleaner, more responsible future.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to our commitment to sustainability, we actively participate in local community programs, from donating supplies to underfunded schools to hosting workshops on environmental awareness. As we look to the future, our mission remains clear: to empower people and businesses to thrive without harming the planet.</p>
